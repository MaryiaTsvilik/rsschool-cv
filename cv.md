### ABOUT ME
``` 
I am a dedicated, organized and result-driven
person who is always seeking ways to perform
better in every aspect of life.

I am always paying attention to the details,
trying to understand reasoning, causes and
consequences. My motto: flexibility, everyday
learning and self-improvement are the keys to
thrive in any situation.

I am curious, proactive and always trying to
find something fascinating and beneficial to my
mind, body, productivity and put it into action. 
I am keen on investigating human psychology
and emotional intelligence. Traveling and
interacting with well-rounded people from
different countries keep me motivated and
widen my horizons.
